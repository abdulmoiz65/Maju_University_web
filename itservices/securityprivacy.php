  <h2><b>Security & Privacy</b></h2><br>

  <h3>Protect Your Computer</b></h3>
  <ul class="list-group">

    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">One of the most important ways you can protect your personally owned computer is to use anti-virus/ anti-malware software, especially if you are running a Microsoft Windows operating system. We strongly recommend that you download and install following anti-virus products. However, there are many steps that should be taken to secure your personal computer no matter what platform you are on.</li>
    
  </ul>

  <h3>Windows Defender</h3> 
  <ul class="list-group">

    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">Windows Defender is free and supported on Windows 10 and Windows 11 respectively, earlier versions of Windows are end-of-life and no longer supported.  Additionally, security patches are no longer available from Microsoft and thus these older versions of Windows (XP/Vista,7,8.x) are highly discouraged from being utilized on the university blocks due to serious security concerns. University owned/issued computers are already having an windows defender installed. </li>
    

  </ul>
  <br><br>

  <h3>Protect Your Mobile Device</h3> 
  <ul class="list-group">

    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">Your mobile phone, tablet, or laptop often contains personal or private data about you, friends, and family.  </li>
    

  </ul>
  <br><br>

  <h3>Protect Your Privacy and Reputation</h3> 
  <ul class="list-group">

    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary"> We all know that social networking is the way to connect with your friends. But have you considered what information you share online? Others have! Security experts agree that your privacy is at risk if you include personal information about yourself, such as full name, address, phone number, or account numbers. It's also important to consider what information and photos are posted by you or others who know you.</li>
    
  </ul>
